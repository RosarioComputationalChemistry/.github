## 🤝 Institutional Affiliations

Our work is carried out through a formal collaboration between two key research institutions in the region:

* **Instituto de Química de Rosario - UNR-CONICET (IQUIR)**.
* **Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingeniería Ambiental, Química y Biotecnología Aplicada - UCA (INGEBIO)**

## 🧪 Research Areas

We focus on developing methodologies and models that accelerate chemical research, including:

1.  **Quantum Calculations (DFT):** Detailed analysis of electronic properties, reaction mechanisms, and activation energies of organic and inorganic reactions.
2.  **Structural Elucidation via NMR:** Development of Computational Chemistry workflows for the prediction and assignment of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra.
3.  **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Models:** Use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and other Machine Learning techniques to predict molecular properties, such as NMR parameters, and optimize molecular design.

## 👥 Group Directors

The group is directed and supervised by the following principal investigators from CONICET (Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas):

* **Dr. Ariel Sarotti** - (IQUIR - UNR)
    * sarotti@iquir-conicet.gov.ar - [**LinkdIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariel-sarotti-283a5a1b9/?originalSubdomain=ar)

* **Dr. María Marta Zanardi** - (INGEBIO - UCA)
    * zanardi@rosario-conicet.gov.ar - [**LinkdIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mar%C3%ADa-marta-zanardi/)

## 🚀 Key Repositories

* **[`gaussian-utils`](link-to-repo):** Primary library for reading and standardizing Gaussian output files (logs, chk) for use across the group.
* **[`gnn-nmr-project`](link-to-repo):** Thesis project focused on applying Graph Neural Networks for the prediction of NMR chemical shifts.

**[⚠️ Note: This group maintains private repositories (Closed Source) for product development in collaboration with Scitrix Tech.]**
